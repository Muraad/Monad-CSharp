# Functional programming and thinking with CSharp
------
##Introduction
Lately i heared a lesson about Haskell programming. Even if im not the biggest fan of the haskell syntax (braces not recommended! ;-) ) , i like the monad and the applicative ideas and the short syntax for complex things, you can do with a (high level) function language.

I was googling a bit about functional programming with C#. I read a lot about lambdas, delegates, linq. I found some Identity called Classes/Interface, and I even found some MaybeÂ´s.

But i dont found some haskell like stuff. Like a IMonad for example, and a ListMonad, MaybeMonad, EitherMonad. Linq is only for lists (or enumerables). And all the other monads i found where isolated classes, that extended some other classes via static methods. But you cannot implement an interface or extend another (abstract) class at the same time. 

And i simply wanted to play around with the functional side of C# and generics. I was starting to programming with C# more than a half year ago in university and in my work. 

I will share my experience about monads, making own IEnumerables/Enumerables (even single value), establish connection to Linq, see basic functional patterns and a lot of generics and delegates in action, and at last how to overload operators in a very unusual way.
